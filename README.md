# swgoh.gg-web-scraper
Web scraper modeled off SHARDcoder's swgoh.gg web scraper with changes to fit my projects needs.

The scraper, based in python, automatically goes through every character's webpage from swgoh.gg and takes their character name, alignment (dark side, light side), as well as their kyrotech counts for both battle computers and shock prods. This scraper takes into account unconvential names and deals with them in their own separate way, but they are all included at the end. This scraped data is then put into a new excel sheet that will be saved locally. 

Additions can be made fairly easily if you want to get more information from the full gear list page, like getting all the carbantis needed, or getting all the gear for G13, etc. As well as going to different webpages for each character and getting other information, like relic materials or common mod sets.
